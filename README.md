# Autocomplete-algo
The main aim of this project:
•	Designed and implemented an autocomplete feature
•	Key data structures include a Trie and Priority Queue to store and search for words most common in Project Gutenberg.

The wiktionary.txt file contains the common words in the english language and cities.txt contains most of the cities in the world.

Autocomplete.java is the main file for this project. One can test this class by compiling on the terminal and running the command:

java Autocomplete wiktionary.txt 5  // the .txt file is present in this directory and the number refers to the number of autocomplete searches the user would like

java Autocomplete cities.txt 5 // similar as above but for cities instead of common words in the english language
